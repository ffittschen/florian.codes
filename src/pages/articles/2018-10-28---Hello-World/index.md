Since I recently finished my studies at Technical University of Munich, I finally had the time to overhaul my blog.
My goal is to write about programming -- primarily about Swift -- and other technical topics that may or may not relate to the Apple ecosystem.
Apart from that, I will add pages of projects I've been working on to the [Projects](/categories/project/) page.
